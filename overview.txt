For the TextID project I plan to use a Christmas theme, to get everyone into the holiday 
spirit! I will compare two Christmas texts: the poem,"A Visit from St. Nicholas" 
by Clement Clarke Moore and the song, "All I Want For Christmas Is You" by Mariah Carey.
While both texts fall under the same theme and have a rhythmic style compared to plain prose, 
I thought it would be unique to see if my project can still work around these nuances 
and find other features that differentiate each text. Since both texts were written 
in different time periods, the poem was published in 1823 and the song was released 
in 1994, I hope to find factors within sentence structures and the overall diction 
each author uses to best "ID" each text. I will be working individually on this project.
